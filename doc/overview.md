# Overview

## Goals

The goals of the Azure IoT Operations SDKS is to provide an application framework to abstract the MQTT concepts, with a clean API, that can also be consumed using _Codegen_ from DTDL models.

The SDKs can be used to build highly available applications at the edge, that interact with Azure IoT Operations to perform operations such as asset discovery, protocol translation and data transformation.

## Language support

Multiple languages are supported, with each language provides an SDK (collectively known as the *Azure IoT Operations SDKs*) with the same level of features and support available in each. The languages supported today are C#, Go and Rust, however additional languages will be added based on customer demand.

## Benefits

The SDKs provide a number of benefits compared to utilizing the MQTT client directly:

| Feature | Benefit |
|-|-|
| **Connectivity** | Maintain a secure connection to the MQTT Broker, including rotating server certificates and authentication keys |
| **Security** | Support SAT or x509 certificate authentication with credential rotation |
| **Configuration** | Configure the Broker connection through the file system, environment or connection string |
| **Services** | Provides client libraries to Azure IoT Operation services for simplified development |
| **Codegen** | Provides contract guarantees between client and servers via RPC and telemetry |
| **High availability** | Building blocks for building HA apps via State Store, Lease Lock and Leader Election clients |
| **Payload formats** | Supports multiple serialization formats, built in |

## Layering

The Azure IoT Operations SDKs provide a number of layers for a customer to engage on:

1. A set of primitive libraries, designed to assist customers in creating applications built on the fundamental protocol implementations, **RPC** and **Telemetry**. 

1. A session client, that augments the MQTT client, adding reconnection and authentication to provide a seemless connectivity experience.

1. A set of clients implementing integration with **Azure IoT Operations services** such as **State Store**, **Leader Election**, **Leased Lock**, and **Schema Registry**.

1. The Protocol Compiler allows clients and servers to communicate via a schema contract. Describe the communication (Telemetry, RPC and serialization) using DTDL, then generate a set of client libraries and server library stubs across a set of popular programming languages.

## Application types

The SDKs supports two different applications types of the edge:

### Edge Application

The edge application is a freeform program to interact with different components on the edge such as the MQTT Broker and the state store. This would typically be used for custom edge logic, where you want full control over how the application is configured and deployed.

### Akri Connector

# How to package connector metadata with 

In order for the user of a connector to access the metadata associated with it, the publisher of a connector must
attach the metadata using ORAS like:

```bash
oras attach <container_registry>/<container_name>:<version> <connector_metadata_file> --artifact-type application/json
```

where the connector metadata file is a JSON file that adheres to the schema defined [here](connector-metadata-schema.json).

# Akri Connector

> [!NOTE]
> The Akri Connector is in active development and will be available as a public preview early 2025.

The Akri connector is part of the Akri services. Akri services simplify the process of modeling leaf devices in the Azure Device Registry.

By building an Akri connector with the Azure IoT Operations SDKs, the application will enable you to model your devices/assets as ARM resources in the Azure Device Registry. The SDK will simplify the access and interaction with Azure IoT Operations components so you can focus on your business logic.

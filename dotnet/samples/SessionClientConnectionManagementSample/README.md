# Session Client Connection Management Sample

This sample code demonstrates the differences between [code using a user-owned MQTT connection](../UserManagedConnectionManagementSample/) and code that relies on the MQTT session client to manage the connection.

By running this sample, you will create an instance of the MQTT session client,  connect to the broker configured in [appsettings.json](./appsettings.json), and begin sending messages.

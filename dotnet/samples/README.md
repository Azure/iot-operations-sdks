# .NET Samples

> [!CAUTION]

> The samples and tutorials provided in this repository are for **demonstration purposed only**, and should not be deployed to a production system or included within an application without a full understanding of how they operate.

> Additionally some samples may use a username and password for authentication. This is used for sample simplicity and a production system should use a robust authentication mechanism such as certificates.

This directory contains a variety of samples demonstrating how to use the .NET packages to interact with Azure IoT Operations.

## Run a sample

> [!TIP]
> Update the `.env` file in the repository root directory to change the authentication method with MQTT broker.

1. Follow the [setup](/doc/setup.md) directions to prepare an Azure IoT Operations cluster for development.

1. Open a shell and navigate to the sample directory

1. Build the sample:

    ```bash
    dotnet build
    ```

1. Run the sample using the default [environment](/.env):

    ```bash
    source `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`/.env; dotnet run
    ```
